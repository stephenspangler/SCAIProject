To run, clone the repository to a directory of your choosing. Go to that directory and launch Chaoslauncher.exe from the Chaoslauncher directory. Select BWAPI 4.1.2 Injector [DEBUG] or BWAPI 4.1.2 Injector [RELEASE] depending on whether you're launching a debug or release DLL. Hit "Config" and on the 6th line, change: 
"ai = ..." to "ai = path/to/your/clone/release/TerranAIModule.dll" 
and 
"ai_dbg = ..." to "ai_dbg = path/to/your/clone/debug/TerranAIModule.dll".
